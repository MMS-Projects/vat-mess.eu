# VAT-MESS

This webpage's intented function is providing information about the new EU law known as VAT-MOSS, also known as VAT-MESS.

The goal is to provide business owners around the EU with easy understandable information about the law.

## What is VAT-MOSS?

VAT-MOSS is a law passed by the EU for using the VAT of the country a product gets bought in. MOSS stands for "Mini One Stop Shop"
